                    My name is Kevin and I am a senior studying Computer Science at Northwestern University. I'm interested in backend and full stack engineering and I am looking for opportunities that challenge me and reflect my values.  
                </p>
                <h2 class="content-subhead">My Values</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Be curious</b>: you never know what's at the end of the rabbit hole</li>
                    <li><b>Keep growing</b>: whether it's intellectually, physically, or spiritually, I want to constantly be better, by gaining new experiences and refining existing skills</li>
                    <li><b>Take pride</b>: always be able to say "I did that and I put my best effort into it"</li>
                    <li><b>Build bridges</b>: life is not a solitary journey, many of our best experiences are shared</li>
                    <li><b>Do good</b>: have a positive impact amongst my peers, my community, and the world</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="content-subhead">Fun Facts</h2>
                <p>
                    I love to be outdoors. I grew up in Seattle, where I was lucky enough to have hiking and skiing right in my backyard. Otherwise, I'm up for whatever pickup sport, soccer, basketball, volleyball, you name it and I'm in. I also enjoy rooting for my favorite Seattle and Northwestern sports teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the weather's not stellar, I like to play video games such as FIFA or Super Smash Bros. I also enjoy reading investigative articles online and watching TV. My two favorite ongoing shows right now are House of Cards and Suits.

                    I interned at the adtech startup TripleLift as a Full Stack Web Developer on the Solutions Engineering team. As a member of the Solutions Engineering, I had the opportunity to participate and interact with clients. However, my role focused more on the coding side of things than the client facing side and I had the opportunity to work on a large variety of projects during my time at TripleLift.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    One of the main projects I worked on involved analyzing the effectiveness of an advertisement placement. To do so, we use a tracking company's software to analyze our ad placements. I wrote an algorithm in PHP that dynamically calculated how often we should use the tracking company's software on each placement, based on the placement's historical performance. This allowed TripleLift to more efficiently analyze placement performance in a more cost-effective way. 
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    I created and improved a few internal tools (Chrome extensions and PHP tools) that optimized processes for both the Engineering and Business Development teams. In working on these tools, I worked with AJAX requests and made my own contributions to the TripleLift API. 
                </p>   
                <p class="lead">
                    I also had the opportunity to work with MySQL and Redshift (Postgres). I worked with the Salesforce API for a migration job, changing it from MySQL to Redshift  and adding new, calculated fields. Using Redshift allowed for queries that ran four times faster than equivalent ones written in MySQL. I also regularly used both databases to generate reports for Sales and Business Development teams.

The first project I worked on was learning how to use the Java SDK to interact with the RESTful API. The objective of this project was to clean up the existing documentation and to write a user guide from the perspective of a new user. In the process, I was also able to help find and address some bugs in the API.

                    <p class="lead">I was also in charge of learning and managing the remote mobile devices using VMware's AirWatch. We had patients across the country with our devices. I setup the remote management software and remotely troubleshooted and debugged patients' mobile devices. This process also involved communicating with AirWatch engineers to develop the features we needed. Unfortunately, AirWatch did not fit our needs and I was able to advise PhysIQ to transition to another service that did fit our needs.

                    For our Knowledge Representation and Reasoning course, my team created a computer player that tracked all guesses made by each player and use this information to win the game. The computer player used a SAT solver (ZChaff) to keep track of where each card was located, whether it was in its own hand, another player's hand, or in the game's solution. Since each card could only be in one location, the computer player would add what it learned to the SAT solver, based on the guesses made by other players and who was able to refute those guesses, until it could determine the solution to the game. We used created this player using Python and the ZChaff SAT solver.

                    For our Machine Learning course, my team used the Spotify and EchoNest API to gather song metadata. We then used nearest neighbor, decision tree, and Naive Bayes net classifiers to analyze which classifier was most effective in predicting whether a song would be a Top 100 song of the year as ranked by Billboards. We found that none of the classifiers worked well because the target set was so small, only one hundred songs out of the thousands of songs that are released each year. However, the decision tree and the Naive Bayes net classifiers worked better than the nearest neighbor classifier.

                    At HackIllinois 2015, my team created a Pebble watch app for passive time management. It simply keeps track of how much time the user is being unproductive and vibrates as a reminder that the time may be better used elsewhere. The Pebble app works in conjunction with a Chrome extension. The Chrome extension checks whether the URL the user is visiting contains any 'unproductive' terms. If so, it updates the status on Firebase, which notifies the watch, starting a timer. At every 'x' time interval, the watch will vibrate to gently remind the user that time is passing.
