                                    I interned at the adtech startup TripleLift as a Full Stack Web Developer. I had the opportunity to work on a large variety of projects during my time at TripleLift.

                                    One of the main projects I worked on involved writing an algorithm in PHP that dynamically calculated how often we should use a tracking company's software on each advertisement placement, based on the placement's historical performance. This allowed TripleLift to more efficiently analyze placement performance in a more cost-effective way.

                                    I also created and improved a few internal tools (Chrome extensions and PHP tools) that optimized processes for both the Engineering and Business Development teams. In working on these tools, I worked with AJAX requests and made my own contributions to the TripleLift API.

                                    I had the opportunity to work with MySQL and Redshift (Postgres). I worked on a job that migrated our databases to Salesforce, changing it from MySQL to Redshift. I regularly used both databases to generate reports for the Sales and Business Development teams.

The first project I worked on was to clean up the documentation and write a user guide for the Java SDK. In the process, I was able to help find and address some bugs in the API.

                                <p class="lead">I was also in charge of managing the remote mobile devices using VMware's AirWatch. I setup the remote management software and remotely troubleshooted and debugged patients' mobile devices. This process also involved communicating with AirWatch engineers to develop the features we needed. Unfortunately, AirWatch did not fit our needs and I was able to advise PhysIQ to transition to another service that did fit our needs.
